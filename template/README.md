# friboo-template

A Leiningen template for Friboo library (https://github.com/zalando-stups/friboo).

This document only describes development guidelines. For usage please refer the the main README of Friboo.

## Development

In order to try the template out without releasing to clojars, install it to the local `~/.m2` and specify `--snapshot` flag:

```
$ lein install
$ cd ../..
$ lein new friboo <project> --snapshot
```

## Testing

So far this is a manual step. Docker is required.

```
$ ./itest.sh
```
